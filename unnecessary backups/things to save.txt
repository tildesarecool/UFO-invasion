it took SO LONG to get all this typed in right
and properly indented
I'm saving this for later
so I can at least look at it


    def _check_events(self):
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                sys.exit()
            elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN: # physically push a key down
                if event.key == pygame.K_UP: # predefined which keyboard key - the up arrow
                    self.ship.moving_up = True
                elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                    self.ship.moving_down = True
            # pushing key down versus releasing key and setting correlating variable to true/false
            elif event.type == pygame.KEYUP:
                if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                    self.ship.moving_up = False # when key released stop moving ship upwards
                elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                    self.ship.moving_down = False
