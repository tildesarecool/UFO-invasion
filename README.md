# UFO-invasion
Adaption (attempted?) of "Python Crash Course" chapters 12, 13 and 14 to be a horizontal shmup. 

I'd like to add additional functionality like variations of the aliens, power ups and of course sound effects and a music track.


## The Good News and the Bad News

I'm now on my second attempt at created this adaption: I got as far as orienting the ship and putting in one alien on right side of the screen. And ship can fire bullets. So I'm essentially going through chapter 12/13/14 a second time with less reading and more copy/pasting. 

Side note: apparently the multi-line python comment method starting/ending with triple quotes 
'''
actually has to be properly indented.
I thought it was just a multi-line comment like the
/* */ 
used in some many other languages. 
Improper indenting of those quotes results in the script not running. Took me a long time to learn that the hard way.
