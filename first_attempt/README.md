Adaption (attempted?) of "Python Crash Course" chapter 12 to be horizontal shmup

Currently trying to update up through chapter 13 of the book.

## The Good News and the Bad News

The script actually runs now. Took me a while to even get that far.

Bad news though i can't control the ship any more, the bullets don't fire and the fleet start at the top and moves down instead of at the right and move left. 

The fleet does move though.

So it's just a matter of figuring out some x/y swapping and further debugging.

I'll perhaps work on this tomorrow

Side note: apparently the multi-line python comment method starting/ending with triple quotes 
'''
actually has to be properly indented.
I thought it was just a multi-line comment like the
/* */ 
used in some many other languages. 
Improper indenting of those quotes results in the script not running. Took me a long time to learn that the hard way.
